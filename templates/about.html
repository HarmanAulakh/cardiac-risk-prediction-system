                <p style="text-align: justify;">Among various life-threatening diseases, heart disease has garnered a great deal of attention in medical research. The diagnosis of heart disease is a challenging task, which can offer automated prediction about the heart condition of patient so that further treatment can be made effective. The diagnosis of heart disease is usually based on signs, symptoms and physical examination of the patient. There are several factors that increase the risk of heart disease, such as smoking habit, body cholesterol level, family history of heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and lack of physical exercise.
                <br> In the healthcare industry, large amounts of data are frequently generated. However, it is often not used effectively. This information supports decision making process on related area. In this, we discussed various approaches of data mining which are useful in predicting the heart disease. One of the complex tasks in healthcare industry is predicting of heart disease and it requires more experience and knowledge. Some of the ways of predicting heart diseases are ECG, stress test and heart MRI etc. Here the system uses 14 parameters for predicting heart disease that include blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain and heart rate. These parameters are used to improve an accuracy level. The obtained results have illustrated that the designed diagnostic system can effectively predict the risk level of heart diseases.</p>

<p>Heart disease is the most common disease. But, unfortunately the treatment of heart disease is somewhat costly that is not affordable by common man.  
Heart disease is common among people who have the triggering factors such as unhealthy diet, obesity, smoking, cholesterol, high blood pressure, high blood glucose, lipids, physical inactivity, risky use of alcohol and hypertension. World Health Organization (WHO) stated that cardiovascular diseases are the primary cause of increasing global death. According to WHO, 17.7 million people
around the world die due to cardiovascular diseases, which estimated 31% of all deaths worldwide as of 2015 report. More precisely, 7.4 million people around the world die due to coronary heart diseases and 6.7 million were due to stroke. Hence, we can reduce this problem in some amount just by predicting heart disease before it becomes dangerous using Analysis and Prediction of Heart Disease and Data mining. If we can find out heart disease problem in early stages then It becomes very helpful for treatment.Machine Learning and Data Mining techniques are used for the construction of Analysis and Prediction of Heart Disease . In healthcare biomedical field, there is large use of heath care data in the form of text, images, etc but, that data is hardly visited and is not mined. So, we can avoid this problem by introducing Analysis and Prediction of Heart Disease .This system will help us reduce the costs and to enhance the quality treatment of heart patients. This system can able to identify complex problems and can able to take intelligent medical decisions. The system can predict likelihood of patients of getting heart problems by their profiles such as blood pressure, age, sex, cholesterol and blood sugar. Also, the performance will be compared by calculation of confusion matrix. This can help to calculate accuracy, precision, and recall. The overall system provides high performance and better accuracy.
</p>
<p>As we know, The healthcare industry collects huge amounts of health care data which, unfortunately, are not mined and analyzed in a proper manner to discover hidden information, to take decisions effectively, to discover the relations that connect patterns. The aim of this paper is to develop a decision support in Heart Disease Prediction System (HDPS) using machine learning's effective algorithms. Using medical profile of the patient (age, gender, blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, chest pain, ECG graph etc.), it can predict the likelihood of patient getting a heart disease. The likelihood (class label) may be of 5 stages: no, low, medium, high and very high. If an unknown sample comes, then the system will predict the class label of the sample. Machine Learning is used across many spheres around the world. The healthcare industry is no exception. Machine Learning can play an essential role in predicting presence/absence of Locomotor disorders, Heart diseases and more. Such information, if predicted well in advance, can provide important insights to doctors who can then adapt their diagnosis and treatment per patient basis.<p>
